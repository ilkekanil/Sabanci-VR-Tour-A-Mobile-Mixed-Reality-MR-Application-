# Sabanci-VR-Tour-A-Mobile-Mixed-Reality-MR-Application

• Used technologies: Unity, AR Foundation, ManoMotion SDK, C#, Android

• Created a mobile Mixed Reality application that guides users through a virtual campus tour of
Sabancı University using only a smartphone.

• Added real-time hand tracking with the ManoMotion SDK, enabling users to interact with
virtual objects using a single grab gesture. No controllers needed.

• Designed location-based mini-games that appear when users physically reach different areas
on campus, encouraging real-world movement and discovery.

• Made sure the app runs smoothly on regular Android phones, so it’s accessible without
expensive VR devices.

• Addressed key limitations in mobile MR by creating a cost-effective, immersive experience
using only a smartphone’s camera and sensors.

• Promoted student engagement
